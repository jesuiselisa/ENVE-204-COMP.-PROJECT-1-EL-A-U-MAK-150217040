# Pipeline-System

In this project, we calculate type-2 and type-3 problems for pipeline system. In type-2, we entering length, diameter, pipe material, allowable head loss, temperature and we learn friction factor, velocity and flow rate. In type-3, we entering length, flow rate, pipe material, allowable head loss, temperature and we learn friction factor, velocity and diameter.
